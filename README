README for work done as a part of Google Summer of Code 2017
============================================================

This readme has been modified to add information for the GSoC project.

As part of the "Adding 3D support" for VLC, primarily core playback support was 
added for tagged 3D files (Side-by-side & Top-Bottom). Secondary milestones include:
a. playback support for libVLC (Windows Universal Platform)
b. playback support for Stereoscopic 3D + 360 files 
c. Side-by-side output for 2D files
d. "Cardboard" output for VR viewing of 3D files.

For the implementation, a new menu option "3D Output" is available under Video. 
The options include:
1. Auto-detect - If a 3D file is detected, and 3D is enabled on the system,
the output is stereoscopic 3D.
2. Stereo - Forcing a 3D output.
3. Left only - Showing only the frames for the left in 2D (Left frame for 
Side-by-side format, Top frame for Top-Bottom format)
4. Right only - Like Left only but with right/bottom frame.
5. Side-by-side - Shows a 2D file side by side, to for example show 2D on 3D TVs.
3D files are shown as the original in 2D.
6. Cardboard - Outputs 2D and 3D files with a lens distoriton to be displayed 
as stereoscopic on Cardboard (VR) headsets.
Stereoscopic 3D + 360 files are displayed in 3D directly on automatic detection.

Note: The branch is rebased from the lastest master as on 26th August, 2017.
Please refer to individual commits for a patch-by-patch breakdown of the project. 


README for the VLC media player
===============================

VLC is a popular libre and open source media player and multimedia engine,
used by a large number of individuals, professionals, companies and
institutions. Using open source technologies and libraries, VLC has been
ported to most computing platforms, including GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X,
BSD, iOS and Android.
VLC can play most multimedia files, discs, streams, allows playback from
devices, and is able to convert to or stream in various formats.
The VideoLAN project was started at the university Ã‰cole Centrale Paris who
relicensed VLC under the GPLv2 license in February 2001. Since then, VLC has
been downloaded close to one billion times.
